# WT Icons

Bundle of **W**ebsite development and **T**echnology icons.

### Install

```shell
yarn add wticons
```

### How to solve a name conflict?

Because these are technology icons, there may be conflicts with library name such as [React](https://reactjs.org/).
This can easily be solved by using an alias:

```shell
import {React as ReactIcon} from 'wticons';
```
